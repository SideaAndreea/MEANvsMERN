# MEAN vs MERN
This project uses the MEAN and MERN stacks, within the same application, the difference being visible on the frontend side where I used different frameworks, specifically Angular and React. 
This project helped me learn and discover the differences between these stacks and choosing between them depending on the needs of the application.
